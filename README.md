**Stock Market Prediction Using Knowledge Graphs**

**Overview**

The stock market plays a crucial role in the global financial ecosystem, providing opportunities for investment and economic growth. However, stock price movements are influenced by numerous factors, including company performance, economic indicators, market sentiment, and geopolitical events, making accurate predictions a complex challenge.

Traditional forecasting models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) often struggle to capture the non-linear relationships and external influences affecting stock prices. This project introduces an alternative approach by leveraging knowledge graphs to enhance stock market predictions using machine learning.

**Project Objectives**

This project aims to:

* Explore the application of knowledge graphs in stock market prediction.

* Construct custom financial knowledge graphs from financial reports (e.g., 10-K reports) to represent relationships between companies, industries, and economic factors.

* Evaluate the predictive performance of machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM) using well-defined metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG@10).

* Compare predictions based on knowledge graphs with those from traditional models to validate the advantages of incorporating relational data.

**Key Features**

* Knowledge Graph Integration: Uses knowledge graphs to represent complex financial relationships.

* Machine Learning Models: Implements Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM for stock price predictions.

* Feature Enrichment: Enhances prediction models with contextual information extracted from financial reports.

* Performance Evaluation: Employs evaluation metrics like RMSE and nDCG@10 to compare model effectiveness.

**Why Knowledge Graphs?**

* Knowledge graphs provide a structured way to visualize and analyze connections between financial entities, helping to:

* Identify sector-wide impacts of stock fluctuations.

* Incorporate qualitative insights (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, CEO changes) into machine learning models.

* Improve predictive accuracy beyond traditional time-series forecasting methods.

**Implementation**

* Data Collection: Extract stock market data and financial reports.

* Knowledge Graph Construction: Build structured graphs capturing company relationships and market influences.

* Feature Engineering: Generate predictive features from knowledge graphs.

* Model Training & Evaluation: Train ML models and evaluate their performance with enriched datasets.
